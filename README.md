# Final Project


## Domain of interest: Pandemics
Why are you interested in this field/domain?
>We are interested in this field to compare COVID-19’s impact and mortality rates to other pandemics due to its relevance at the moment. Doing so can spread awareness in terms of how deadly this virus is and how important it is to shelter in place right now.

## What other examples of data driven projects have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
[This infographic](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/history-of-pandemics-deadliest/) shows the history of pandemics and a visual size representation of each pandemic compared to each other by ‘Visual Capitalist’.

[This project](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/covid19-vs-sars-vs-mers-vs-ebola-vs-h1n1/data) compares the number of deaths, cases, and mortality rate across the five different pandemics, H1N1, Ebola, MERs, SARs and COVID19. It includes datasets as well for each outbreak.

[This project](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2014/oct/15/visualised-how-ebola-compares-to-other-infectious-diseases) compares the effects of the Ebola virus to other infectious diseases by David McCandless.


## What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

1. Is COVID-19 as deadly as the media makes it out to be in comparison to previous pandemics?

2. How does the death rate/ recovery rate compare to past pandemics?

3. How much longer will this pandemic persist in comparison to past pandemics?


# Questions for Datasets:

1. Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
How was the data collected or generated?

2. Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?

3. How many observations (rows) are in your data?

4. How many features (columns) are in the data?

5. What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?

## Jon’s dataset:

1. https://datahub.io/core/covid-19#data

  a. https://datahub.io/core/covid-19/r/2.html
2. The 2 authors of this dataset are Adam Kariv and Rufus Polluck who built CKAN, the world’s leading data portal platform that powers sites like data.gov and data.gov.uk. It provides information of every country and its number of confirmed cases, if they recovered, and number of deaths that occurred there due to the coronavirus. It also tells us the date of which the deaths were recorded starting 1/22
3. 20384 rows
4. 5 columns
5. This dataset will be crucial in answering the 3 data-driven questions above since it provides all the data regarding deaths and recovers of patients that will be compared to other pandemics.

## Fame’s dataset

1. https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/ebola-outbreak-20142016-complete-dataset
2. The data was collected from https://www.who.int/csr/don/archive/disease/ebola/en/. The World Health Organization is responsible for international public health. The data was used to identify the cases and effects of the Ebola virus, dating from August 2014-March 2016.
3. 2485 rows are in the data
4. 10 columns are in the data
5. The dataset can prove that COVID-19 is more deadly than the Ebola virus in terms of number of cases and number of suspected deaths.

## Victoria’s dataset:

1. https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/sars-2003-outbreak-analysis
2. This link provides data for the SARs outbreak in 2003. Originally, the SARs data was accumulated from multiple daily datasets from the WHO (World Health Organization) website (https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/en/), now combined into one file. This SARs file contains the number of confirmed SARs cases, related deaths, and recovered patients from March to July of 2003 for multiple countries.
3. There are 2,538 rows of data.
4. There are five columns: date, country, cumulative number of cases, number of deaths, and number of recovered patients.
5. This dataset can help compare other pandemics to SARs recovery and death rate, as well as the duration of the SARs pandemic.

## Isaac’s dataset:

1. http://www.ufiddynamics.org/data
2. This link leads to two separate datasets regarding the influenza outbreak in 1918. This data was originally collected as part of project Tycho, which was meant to catalog all significant weekly disease reports since 1888.
3. The Points Table contains 8035 observations, with 5 features.
4. The Strata Table contains 3473 observations, with 17 features.
5. This dataset can be used to compare the death rate and other potentially notable statistics such as age and employment to COVID
